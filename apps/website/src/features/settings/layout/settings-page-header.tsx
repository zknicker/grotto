/**
 * The one thing settings composition still owns: a page's identity.
 *
 * Sections and rows are stock `ItemCardGroup`/`ItemCard`. The local
 * `SettingsSection`/`SettingsGroup`/`SettingsItem` kit that used to live beside
 * this is gone — it was a parallel implementation of those parts that drifted
 * on heading size, row padding, and left edge. Do not reintroduce one.
 *
 * A settings page's identity: title and description. Page-level actions do not
 * belong here — they go in the shell band through `PageTopbar`, which is
 * otherwise empty on settings routes.
 *
 * Three details carry the whole block, and all three were wrong:
 *
 * - `px-4` puts the title on the same left edge as `ItemCardGroup`'s own header
 *   and row text below it. At `px-1` the page title sat 12px inside everything
 *   it headed, so the column had two left edges.
 * - Semibold with tight tracking, not bold. Inter at 22px/700 with default
 *   tracking is the browser's idea of a heading, not a designed one.
 * - The description is body copy: the same `text-sm` step as every row title,
 *   row description, and table cell under it, on its natural leading. It was
 *   `leading-tight`, which reads as a caption on one line and collapses into a
 *   block when it wraps. Stepping it up to `text-base` instead made it the
 *   largest thing on the page after the title, which is not what a subtitle is
 *   for — the space above and below it does that work.
 *
 * `meta` is the alternative to `description` for a page about one record: the
 * facts that identify it, rather than a sentence explaining what the page is.
 * A Computer's system, version, and last contact say more than any sentence
 * about Computers could, and they change — a static line does not. Prose in
 * `description`, structured facts in `meta`; a page rarely wants both.
