 * open transaction, once transactions run long enough to queue behind one
 * another — as every durable write does here, since they serialize on the
 * Server row. The stray query then runs inside that transaction, and the
 * transaction's own `select ... for update` is orphaned on a connection the
 * pool has already handed on: the Server row lock is never released and every
 * later durable write queues behind it forever. A client that only ever runs
 * transactions has no plain queries to leak into one, so the split holds the
 * invariant Bun's pool does not.
 *
 * Remove the split once Bun isolates reserved connections, and take
 * `transaction` straight off the query pool again.
