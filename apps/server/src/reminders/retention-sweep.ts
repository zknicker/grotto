/**
 * Deletes expired reminder history: every fire older than the retention
 * window, and every reminder that settled before it.
 *
 * A fire is one history entry, so it expires on its own `fired_at` clock no
 * matter what its reminder is doing. A recurring reminder therefore keeps its
 * row and its recent fires while its old ones drop away; a one-shot's last fire
 * usually leaves with the reminder itself.
 *
 * `updated_at` is the moment a reminder settled — the fire transaction and
 * cancellation both stamp it — so it is the reminder's retention clock. Only
 * `fired` and `canceled` rows are settled. A recurring reminder stays
 * `scheduled` between fires and is never swept, however old it is; its own
 * cancellation is what starts its retention window.
 *
 * Age is not the only condition: a fire whose wake is still queued for its
 * Agent — a `reminder_agent_attention` row — is unfinished business, not
 * history, and the sweep leaves it and its reminder alone however old they are.
 * The Agent seeing the wake drops that row, and the next pass takes the fire.
 *
 * The reminder row is the parent of its whole record: `reminder_fires`,
 * `reminder_commands`, `reminder_agent_attention`, and the `reminder.changed`
 * events all cascade from it, and a fire row is the parent of the
 * `reminder_agent_attention` row that names it. Provenance is the exception:
 * `message_causes` snapshots what the mark says and outlives the reminder, so
 * sweeping history leaves the Agent's answer marked with the automation that
 * provoked it, reading archived (ADR 0026).
