 * interaction, so the row carries none and the remove button carries the only
 * one. Filled or empty, the roster is the same box, so adding and removing
 * Agents never moves the dialog.
 *
 * An empty roster is a state, not a missing row: the box says so itself in the
 * stock EmptyState, centred, muted, and carrying the rule it is waiting on — so
 * the line under the box has nothing left to repeat and nothing to shout.

/**
 * The one fixed box every roster state is drawn in: the list, its empty state,
 * and the wait for the Agents that fill it.
 *
 * The height is chosen off the row rhythm rather than the content, so the
 * dialog cannot resize itself while it is being used. A row is a `sm` Button
 * tall — `--spacing × 9` below `md`, `× 8` above — on a `× 2` gap, and the box
 * stops deliberately short of a whole number of rows: five rows and a slice of
 * the sixth, so an overflowing roster says so at its bottom edge before anyone
 * scrolls.
 *
 * The height is the frame's, not the scroller's, because `ScrollShadow` learns
 * it has something to fade from a `ResizeObserver` on itself. Pin the scroller
 * to a fixed height and it stops resizing, so a roster that grows past the box
 * never gets its fade until the first scroll. Left to size itself against a
 * `max-height`, it resizes exactly when the clamp engages — which is exactly
 * when the fade has to appear or go.
 *
 * `isCentered` is the one state that may pin it: content that cannot overflow
 * has no fade to lose, and a definite height is what lets that content sit in
 * the middle of the box instead of at its top.
 *
 * A control paints outside its own box — 4px of focus ring — and flush against
 * the scroll container it was clipped on every side, because the remove button
 * is exactly as tall as its row. So the scroller insets its content and the
 * frame hands the same amount straight back as negative margin: the padded box
 * and the margin box cancel, rows stay on the dialog's content edge and in the
 * same rhythm, and the ring has somewhere to land.
