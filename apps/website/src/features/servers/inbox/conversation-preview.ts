/**
 * A Chat's newest message as the one line a row quotes: who spoke, then what
 * they said, flattened by the same helper every other quoting surface uses.
 *
 * The prefix is dropped when the row's own title already answers it. Tiny's DM
 * read `Tiny: Finished the audit` — the name stated twice, once as the row's
 * title and once inside its own quote — so in a DM the peer speaks unattributed
 * and only the viewer's own line is marked, as `You:`. A Channel keeps every
 * name, because there the author is the fact the reader is scanning for.
 *
 * Null is the Chat that holds no message yet — the row states that itself
 * rather than quoting an empty line. A message whose content flattens to
 * nothing (an attachment on its own) still names its author, which is all
 * there is left to say about it.
 *
 * Authors are matched by display name because `ChatLastMessage` carries no
 * author id. This is a presentation choice inside one row, never identity:
 * the worst a collision does is drop or add a prefix.
