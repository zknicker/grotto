 * Merges a Run's newly reported branch evidence over what it already carried.
 *
 * The branch report itself is replaced wholesale — it is the provider's own
 * current answer about which branches a Run wrote. The pull-request snapshot on
 * a branch is different: the Computer reads it from GitHub and may fail to,
 * which is reported as no snapshot at all. Losing a recorded snapshot because
 * one read timed out would make a card forget facts it had already shown, so an
 * absent snapshot keeps the recorded one, and a reported snapshot replaces a
 * recorded one only when its own `observedAt` is at least as new.
